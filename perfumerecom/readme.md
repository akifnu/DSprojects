# 🟢 Perfume Recommender

## Introduction

**Perfume Recommender** is an AI-powered tool designed to help anyone find their perfect scent—not just by brand or name, but by emotion, memory, or mood. Powered by advanced language models and intelligent ranking, this system bridges the gap between what you *feel* and what you want to smell.

## ✨ The Story

This project began as a personal journey through countless perfume shops during my travels. I noticed that most customers didn’t come in asking for a specific bottle or brand. Instead, they would describe a cherished memory, a special feeling, or a fleeting emotion—a summer by the sea, a joyful party, or the thrill of new beginnings. Shop staff, often caught off-guard by these requests, would bring out bottle after bottle, and the search could become a long, tiring process.

These experiences inspired me to use artificial intelligence to help both perfume lovers and small shops quickly retrieve perfumes that truly match the customer’s story or feeling. Perfume is more than a product; it’s a gateway to our deepest memories.
